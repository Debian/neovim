Description: heavily refactored vim fork
 Neovim is a fork of Vim focused on modern code and features, rather than
 running in legacy environments.
 .
 msgpack API enables structured communication to/from any programming language.
 Remote plugins run as co-processes that communicate with Neovim safely and
 asynchronously.
 .
 GUIs (or TUIs) can easily embed Neovim or communicate via TCP sockets using
 the discoverable msgpack API.
